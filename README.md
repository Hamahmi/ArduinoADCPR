# ArduinoADCPR

This is an Arduino Project that takes an analog signal from a photoresistor and converts it to a digital signal that controls an LED;
In simple words, if connected properly, the LED is ON when it is dark and it goes off when there is a light.

Arduino Mega 2560 is used. The code is in assembly and Atmel Studio 7.0 is used to burn the code.
